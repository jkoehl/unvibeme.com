                    now in marketing. The chatbot has no memory of the conversation. You have

                    <h3>Do you offer emergency services?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. Our Rapid Response team is available 24/7 for critical situations, such as
                       "the payment system is giving customers free money" or "we just discovered our
                       user database is publicly accessible."</p>

                    <h3>Will you judge us?</h3>
                    <p>Professionally? Never. Internally? We're only human. But we've seen things that would
                       make senior engineers weep, and we maintain strict confidentiality. Your secrets die with us
                       and our extremely thorough NDAs.</p>

                    <h3>Can you help us use AI tools effectively?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. AI-assisted development can be incredibly productive—when guided by
                       someone who understands what they're building. We help teams establish practices
                       where AI accelerates experienced developers rather than replacing engineering
                       judgment entirely.</p>

                    <h3>Are you anti-AI?</h3>
                    <p>Not at all. Our engineers use AI tools daily. The issue isn't AI—it's delegating
                       critical thinking to a system that can't say "this is a bad idea." AI is a force
                       multiplier: it multiplies whatever engineering skill you bring to it, including none.</p>

                    <h3>Why is our codebase so large?</h3>
                    <p>AI models optimize for helpfulness, not simplicity. Need a function to format a date?
                       Here's a 200-line utility class, a custom exception hierarchy, three design patterns,
                       and internationalization support you didn't ask for. We find what your code actually
                       needs to do and delete the rest.</p>
